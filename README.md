# NYC-Subway-Analysis
Python code and write up of rain impact on NYC subway ridership
This project was the first project I submitted to Udacity.  Using a Mann-Whitney U test between NYC subway rider groups split between when it rains and when it does not rain, I show that rain does postively impact ridership numbers.
